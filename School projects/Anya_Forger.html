                    Anya Forger is the deuteragonist of the SPY x FAMILY series. Formerly known as Test Subject "007", she is a telepath whose abilities were created in an experiment conducted by an unknown organization.<br><br>
                    She is a student in Cecile Hall at Eden Academy and the adopted daughter of Loid Forger and Yor Forger.
                <h2>Appearance</h2><hr>
                <h4>
                    Anya is a short young girl with fair skin and green eyes. Loid describes her as appearing about four to five years old at the oldest. Her green eyes are large and oval-shaped with prominent eyelashes. She has shoulder-length, light pink hair that curls inwards with a fringe that reaches just above her eyes and a small strand of ahoge at the top of her head. Anya is noticeably shorter than most of her peers and many of the insults Damian and his friends direct at her target her small size. However in Damian's view, she gains a prettier appearance.<br><br>
                    When Loid met Anya for the first time in the orphanage: she wore a simple black dress with a white ribbon at the front, along with white folded-down socks and black shoes. She also wears two black hair ornaments with bright yellow embellishments that resemble small horns on the sides of her head. Anya is never seen with her hair ornaments off, even wearing them to sleep.<br><br>
                    At Eden Academy, Anya wears the standard uniform with white knee-high socks and black Mary Janes. She carries around a brown schoolbag with a sheep keychain attached. During physical education class, Anya also ties her hair back with a red headband and wears the school gym uniform, along with white socks and white gym shoes.<br><br>
                    When she was younger, her hair was slightly shorter and she did not wear the horn-like hair ornaments, instead, her hair was tied into small buns at the sides of her head. She also wore clothing that resembled scrubs.<br><br>
