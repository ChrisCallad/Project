                    Yor Forger is the third main character in Spy X Family. While she works as an ordinary worker at Berlint City Hall, she also leads an unknown life as an assassin with the code name "Thorn Princess". She and Loid Forger got married for separate goals, along with becoming the mother of the adopted child, Anya.
                <h2>Appearance</h2><hr>
                <h4>
                    Yor is a very beautiful, graceful and fairly tall young woman with fair skin, long black hair, and upturned red eyes. She splits her hair into two parts and crosses it over her head, securing it with a headband and forming two thick locks of hair that reach below her chest. When her hair is down, she lacks the usual two thick locks of hair, and her hair reaches about mid-back. <br> <br>
                    At home, Yor generally wears a backless red off-shoulder sweater with black tights, a red skirt, and brown-heeled ankle boots. She wears a white headband and a pair of dangling gold earrings in the shape of small spikes. When going outside, she wears a long beige coat with black buttons over her clothes. <br> <br>
                    At Berlint City Hall, she wears the standard work uniform, consisting of a white long-sleeved shirt with a sleeveless green vest over it, a knee-length green office skirt, and black heels. <br> <br>
                    As an assassin, Yor wears a form-fitting halter-style black dress that shows off her shoulders and cleavage, with a rose choker and a red rose pattern on the inside of her skirt. The front of the skirt is mid-thigh length, while the back reaches below her knees. She also wears a pair of black thigh-high boots and black fingerless gloves. The headband she wears is gold-colored with a rose and two spikes on each side. Her weapons are of the same color as well. This outfit was the only good dress she had before marrying Loid, after which she purchases more formal wear to better present herself for Eden Academy's interview. <br> <br>
                    As a child, Yor had shorter hair that reached just below chin-length.
