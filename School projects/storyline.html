    In order to maintain the state of peace between the rival nations of Westalis and Ostania,[b] a Westalian agent code-named <b>"Twilight"</b> is tasked with spying on Donovan Desmond, leader of the National Unity Party within Ostania. However, due to Desmond being notoriously reclusive, the only way <b>Twilight</b> can get close to him is to enroll a child in the same private school as Desmond's sons and pose as a fellow parent.

To accomplish this and present the image of a happy family,<b> he</b> creates the alias of <b>Loid Forger</b>, adopts a young orphan girl named <b>Anya</b>, and marries a woman named <b>Yor Briar</b>. However, unbeknownst to him <b>Anya</b> can read minds and <b>Yor</b> is in fact a professional assassin. Neither <b>Loid</b> nor <b>Yor</b> are aware of each other's true identities, or that <b>Anya</b> knows their true professions. The family later takes in a dog with precognitive abilities whom they name <b>Bond</b>. Despite these unknown factors and <b>Twilight's</b> occasional lapses of common sense due to years of being a spy, he must learn to play the role of the perfect father and husband in order to carry out his mission.
